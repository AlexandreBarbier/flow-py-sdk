# flow-py-sdk

Another unofficial flow blockchain python sdk.

Under development! Currently this is close to an "MVP" it is mostly missing more of: docs, tests, examples and organization.

If you do want to use it, install it with:

`pip install flow-py-sdk`

Or if using poetry:

`poetry add flow-py-sdk`
