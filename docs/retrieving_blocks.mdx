A block contains the following fields:

- `ID` - The ID (hash) of the block.
- `ParentBlockID` - The ID of the previous block in the chain.
- `Height` - The height of the block in the chain.
- `CollectionGuarantees` - The list of collections included in the block.
- `BlockSeal` - The list of block seals.
- `signatures` - BLS signatures of consensus nodes.

You can use the `GetLatestBlock` method to fetch the latest sealed or unsealed block:

```python
# First Step : Create a client to connect to the flow blockchain
# flow_client function creates a client using the host and port
async with flow_client(
        host=ctx.access_node_host, port=ctx.access_node_port
    ) as client:
        block = await client.get_latest_block(
            is_sealed = False
            # or is_sealed = True can be used for reteriving sealed block
        )
        print("Block :\n")
        print(block.__dict__)
```
You can use the `get_block_by_i_d` method to fetch the specific block with desired ID:

```python
async with flow_client(
    host=ctx.access_node_host, port=ctx.access_node_port
) as client:
    latest_block = await client.get_latest_block()
    block = await client.get_block_by_height(
        height = latest_block.height
    )
    print("Block :\n")
    print(block.__dict__)
```
Also `get_block_by_height` method can be used to fetch the specific block with desired height:

```python
async with flow_client(
    host=ctx.access_node_host, port=ctx.access_node_port
) as client:
    latest_block = await client.get_latest_block()
    block = await client.get_block_by_height(
        height = latest_block.height
    )
    print("Block :\n")
    print(block.__dict__)
```
