# Contributing

Any contributions are very welcome.

If you would like to contribute to the code, the best place to start is to run the [examples](./examples.md) locally. After that your environment will be set up for development.

If you don't have anything specific in mind but still want to contribute make sure to check the [roadmap](./roadmap.md) for ideas.
