An event is emitted as the result of a transaction execution. Events are either user-defined events originating from a Cadence smart contract, or built-in Flow system events.
An event contains the following fields:

- `type` - Fully-qualified unique type identifier for the event.
- `transaction_id` - ID of the transaction the event was emitted from.
- `transaction_index` - Zero-based index of the transaction within the block.
- `event_index` - Zero-based index of the event within the transaction.
- `payload` - Event fields encoded as JSON-Cadence values.

You can query events with the `get_events_for_height_range` function or at a specific block using `get_events_for_block_i_ds` :
## query events with the `get_events_for_height_range` function:

```python
async def run(self, ctx: Config):
    # First Step : Create a client to connect to the flow blockchain
    # flow_client function creates a client using the host and port
    async with flow_client(
            host=ctx.access_node_host, port=ctx.access_node_port
        ) as client:
            events = await client.get_events_for_height_range(
                type = "", start_height = 0, end_height = 0
            )
            print("Events :\n")
            print(events)
```
note:
If `start_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return an error.
If `end_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return events up to and including the latest sealed block.


### `get_events_for_height_range` parameters

An event query includes the following fields:

**Type**

The event type to filter by. Event types are namespaced by the account and contract in which they are declared.

For example, a `Transfer` event that was defined in the `Token` contract deployed at account `0x55555555555555555555` will have a type of `A.0x55555555555555555555.Token.Transfer`.

Read the [language documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/language/events/) for more information on how to define and emit events in Cadence.

**StartHeight, EndHeight**

The blocks to filter by. Events will be returned from blocks in the range `StartHeight` to `EndHeight`, inclusive.

## query events with the `get_events_for_block_i_ds` function:

```python
async with flow_client(
        host=ctx.access_node_host, port=ctx.access_node_port
    ) as client:
        latest_block = await client.get_latest_block()
        events = await client.get_events_for_block_i_ds(
            type = "", block_ids = [latest_block.id]
        )
        print("Events :\n")
        print(events)
```
