A collection is a batch of transactions that have been included in a block. Collections are used to improve consensus throughput by increasing the number of transactions per block.
A collection contains the following fields:

- `id` - SHA3-256 hash of the collection contents.
- `transaction_ids` - Ordered list of transaction IDs in the collection.

## retrieve collections using the `get_collection_by_i_d` function:

```python
async with flow_client(
        host=ctx.access_node_host, port=ctx.access_node_port
    ) as client:
        collection = await client.get_collection_by_i_d(
            id = bytes.fromhex(collection_id)
        )
        print("Collection :\n")
        print(collection.__dict__)
```
