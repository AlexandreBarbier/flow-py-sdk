Flow uses [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)
to control access to user accounts. Each key pair can be used in combination with
the SHA2-256 or SHA3-256 hashing algorithms.
### Supported Algorithms

Hashing algorithms that is supported in Flow:
- SHA2_256
- SHA2_384
- SHA3_256
- SHA3_384

Sgining algorithms that is supported in Flow:
- SECP256k1
- SECP256k1

Here's a full list of the supported signature and hash algorithms: [Flow Signature & Hash Algorithms](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/accounts-and-keys/#supported-signature--hash-algorithms)

Here's how to generate an ECDSA private and public keys for the P-256 (secp256r1) curve:

```python
from ecdsa import NIST384p,SigningKey
private_key = SigningKey.generate()
public_key = private_key.get_verifying_key()

# Also you can use seed string for creating keys
# note: this is only an example, please use a secure random generator for the key seed

secexp = randrange_from_seed__trytryagain(seed, sign_algo.get_signing_curve().order)
private_key = SigningKey.from_secret_exponent(secexp, curve = sign_algo.get_signing_curve())

```

The private key can then be encoded as bytes (i.e. for storage):

```python
encPrivateKey := privateKey.encode()
```

A private key has an accompanying public key:

```python
public_key = private_key.get_verifying_key()
```

### Other methods
There are two other methods for creating account key

#### from_proto
if you want to retrieve account key of an excisting account from Flow, you can use this method.

```python
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
account = loop.run_until_complete(get_account_from_proto())
acc_key = AccountKey.from_proto(account.keys[0])
```
notice an account can as multiple keys so you should choose one you want.

#### from_seed 
using this method You can easily create a pair key. this method use ECDSA library as describe above for creating private and public key.
It return an AccountKey and InMemorySigner Object that can be use for further actions.

```python
# note: this is only an example, please use a secure random generator for the key seed
get_account_key_from_seed(seed = "elephant ears space cowboy octopus rodeo potato cannon pineapple")
```
