# Running the emulator

To run the examples, the [flow emulator](https://github.com/onflow/flow-emulator) needs to be running locally. 
To do that you can use the following instructions or the instructions directly at https://github.com/onflow/flow-emulator.

1. Install the [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli).

2. Start the Flow Emulator in the `examples` directory of this repository (where the `flow.json` config is) using the command:

```sh
flow emulator start
```
