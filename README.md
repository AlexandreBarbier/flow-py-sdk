# flow-py-sdk

Another unofficial flow blockchain python sdk.

Under development! I do not recommend you use this

## Prerequisites

- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

## Examples

First, install the [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli).

Start the Flow Emulator in the main directory of this repository:

- `flow emulator start`
- `poetry build` (only the first time)
- `poetry install`
- `poetry run examples`
